HeidelBridge is a firmware for ESP32 microcontrollers. It allows you to bring your [Heidelberg wallbox](https://www.heidelberg-wallbox.eu) into your WiFi network. This is done by turning your wallbox into a [Daheimladen](https://www.daheimladen.de/) compatible device. This way the wallbox can easily be integrated into home energy management systems like [evcc](https://github.com/evcc-io/evcc).

# Roadmap

For the upcoming version **3.0** some nice enhancements are planned:
- :star: Pre-built binaries: no need to clone and compile the repositoiry yourself
- :star: OTA updates: simply update your HeidelBridge via WiFi
- :star: Wifi provisioning: easily integrate HeidelBridge into your home network

The new version is planned to be released in 2025. Stay tuned!

# Required Hardware

You only need two components for this project: an ESP32 microcontroller and a MAX485 module. Both are available in large quantities and at reasonable prices on the Internet. You will also need a breadboard and a few jumper wires. All in all, it shouldn't cost you more than 10$.

Parts list:
- ESP32 microcontroller*
- MAX485 breakout board
- 6 jumper wires
- A breadboard

This should be enough for quickly putting together a fully functioning prototype.
Of course a well designed PCB would be much nicer, but this is still work in progress. Once the design is ready, the schematics will be available *right here*.

> *\* This project is currently based on the classic ESP32. It has not been built/tested for newer models, like the S2 and C6.*

# Setting Up The ESP32

## Development Environment

To compile this project you will need to install VS Code and the PlatformIO extension. Both are available for free for Linux, MacOS and Windows.

## Programming your ESP32

- Start by cloning or downloading this repository.
- Change `board = ...` in platformio.ini to match the ESP32 board you are actually using.
- Copy the file `Credentials.cpp.template` to `Credentials.cpp`.
- Change the SSID and password in `Credentials.cpp` to match your home network settings.
- If you want to use MQTT, also insert your MQTT server's address and your user name / password (can be left empty if not required).
- Compile the project.
- Now connect your ESP32 via USB and upload the firmware.

# Hardware Installation

## Configuring The Heidelberg Wallbox

1. Disconnect the wallbox from the power supply.
2. Open the housing.
3. Set DIP switch S4 pin 4 to 1 (this sets the Modbus ID to 1).
4. Set DIP switch S6 pin 2 to 1 (this enables the 120 Ohm termination).

## Connecting the Hardware Components

The hardware connections are very simple:
- ESP32's GND to MAX485-board GND
- ESP32's 3.3 V to MAX485-board VCC
- ESP32 pin 18 to MAX485-board RO pin
- ESP32 pin 19 to MAX485-board DI pin
- ESP32 pin 21 to MAX485-board DE+RE pins
- MAX485-board A terminal to Heidelberg wallbox A terminal
- MAX485-board B terminal to Heidelberg wallbox B terminal

# Setting Up evcc

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please make sure that you set up your HeidelBridge **before** adding it to evcc. Evcc won't start up, if it can't find your HeidelBridge! 

Adding your HeidelBridge to evcc is very straight forward.
Start by defining a new charger:

```
chargers:
  - name: heidelberg_ec
    type: template
    template: daheimladen-mb
    host: 192.168.178.133 # IP address or hostname
    port: 502 # Port (optional) 
```

Next, add a loadpoint:

```
loadpoints:
  - title: Heidelberg EC
    charger: heidelberg_ec
    mode: off
    guardduration: 5m
```

Aaaaaand you're done!
Start evcc with your new configuration and the HeidelBridge should be there.

# Setting up Home Assistant

HeidelBridge offers a simple MQTT API (see below). It also supports Home Assistant's MQTT auto discovery feature.
This way HeidelBridge can easily be added to Home Assistant:
 - Make sure the MQTT integration in Home Assistant is enabled.
 - Power on your HeidelBridge.
 - The HeidelBridge should immediately show up as an MQTT device.

GUI Example:
