HeidelBridge is a firmware for ESP32 microcontrollers. It allows you to bring your [Heidelberg wallbox](https://www.heidelberg-wallbox.eu) into your WiFi network. This is done by turning your wallbox into a [Daheimladen](https://www.daheimladen.de/) compatible device. This way the wallbox can easily be integrated into home energy management systems like [evcc](https://github.com/evcc-io/evcc).

# Required Hardware

You only need two components for this project: an ESP32 microcontroller and a MAX485 module. Both are available in large quantities and at reasonable prices on the Internet. You will also need a breadboard and a few jumper wires. All in all, it shouldn't cost you more than 10â‚¬.

Parts list:
- ESP32 microcontroller*
- MAX485 breakout board
- 6 jumper wires
- A breadboard

This should be enough for quickly putting together a fully functioning prototype.
Of course a well designed PCB would be much nicer, but this is still work in progress. Once the design is ready, the schematics will be available *right here*.

> *\* This project is currently based on the classic ESP32. It has not been built/tested for newer models, like the S2 and C6.*

# Getting Started

To get your very own HeidelBridge up and running follow these guides:
- Step 1: [Programming the ESP32](/docs/SoftwareSetup.md)
- Step 2: [Hardware Setup](/docs/HardwareSetup.md)

# Keeping Your HeidelBridge Up-To-Date

Heidelbridge supports OTA (Over The Air) updates. That means that you can update the device firmware via WiFi without physical access to the device. This process is described here: [updating your HeidelBridge](/docs/SoftwareSetup.md#updating-your-heidelbridge).

# Using HeidelBridge With evcc

Adding your HeidelBridge to evcc is very straight forward.
See [these instructions](/docs/evcc.md) for details.

# Using HeidelBridge With Home Assistant

HeidelBridge can easily be integrated into Home Assistant. Check out [this guide](/docs/HomeAssistant.md) to get started.
